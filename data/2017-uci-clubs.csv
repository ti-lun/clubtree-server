We believe the confusion primarily stems from the complex, interdisciplinary nature of climate change and the misrepresentation of facts by certain groups and individuals.\r\n\r\nAcademic and public views about climate change diverge greatly when comparing university lectures with mainstream websites, media coverage, and political leaders. Climatepedia will make climate information more accessible and transparent.\r\n\r\nAs a result of conflicting information available to the public, little progress has been made toward a comprehensive legislative solution. Therefore, we hope to educate readers about current academic climate change research to supplement the widely publicized information from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\r\n\r\nOrganizations like RealClimate and NASA convey the complexity of academic climate research, but the material is not easily understood by the public.
