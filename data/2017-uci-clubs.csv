The high obesity rate in the United States has become the most prominent domestic health issue of the 21st century. Obesity-driven mortalities lead the nation's top 10 leading causes of death: cardiovascular disease ranks first, followed closely by cerebrovascular disease and diabetes. The annual medical cost of obesity is estimated to be $147 billion dollars in 2008, growing at 10% per decade.Health Guardians America focuses on the behavioral aspect to incentivize, educate, and promote long-term healthy habits — reducing the probability of heart attacks, strokes, and diabetes over a lifetime. We offer customized health programmes for college students and high school students using mobile technology.FITLIFE is a nationwide health campaign against heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. We focus on primary medicine and prevention for sustained, long-term protection against leading chronic diseases and illnesses.The goals of the FITLIFE program are to:1. Decrease the obesity risk among youth and young adults to preserve longevity and quality of life. 2. Influence the appropriate lifestyle change and develop healthy decision-making at an early age. 3.
